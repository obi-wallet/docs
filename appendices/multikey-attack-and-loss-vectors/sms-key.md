# SMS Key

can be lost if:

* the SIM card is lost in a context where the phone number cannot then be recovered. (There are potential exceptions: see _**SMS Providers**_)
* the security answer is irrecoverably forgotten
* all SMS providers terminate all provider accounts servicing Obi accounts

Non-duress attacks include:

* SIM swap attacks
* physical theft of the device in an unlocked state or with insecure settings (e.g. message notifications display text even when locked)
* an SMS provider is compromised

Both attacks are mitigated by the security answer, especially in combination with _Security Notifications_.
