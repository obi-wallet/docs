# üîç Signet

Obi Signet enables **multi-chain account abstraction** for the first time: with one secure account and one flexible set of rules, users can manage addresses, apps, and assets on any chains they wish.

With Signet, Obi Accounts on any chain can control addresses on any other chain, even without IBC connection. This can even allow an Obi extension or app to pretend to be any other wallet extension.

Anytime you want to act on a new chain, your account, your [multikey](../multikey/ "mention"), and your [extra-life.md](../extra-life.md "mention") and other settings are already active. Bring them with you without any setup.

Signet is a seamless, zero-setup multichain user experience. Try it in Early Access today at [obi.money](https://obi.money).
