# üèá Fast Travel

Fast Travel allows users to one-click move from ETH, USDC, or another common asset into an asset or strategy in a different ecosystem.

Fast Travel Tunnels are non-custodial in design, using the power of Obi Accounts and Obi Automatons to create pre-authorized fast travel routes which the user custodies without having to hand-hold their assets through the entire travel process (bridging, paying gas, swapping, etc.).

You can try Fast Travel Early Access with select assets now at [obi.money](https://obi.money).
