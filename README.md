## Obi Setup is the Most Secure and Convenient for Users&#x20;

### **Multikey Authentication**

[üîí Multikey](the-obi-smart-account-suite/multikey/) combines biometrics, device-based keys, and cloud authentication to safeguard assets. This customizable multi-factor setup eliminates the need for vulnerable seed phrases and passwords.

***

### **All-Chain Signet Technology**

[üîç Signet](the-obi-smart-account-suite/signet/) allows users to control every chain from a single point, with universal policies including recovery, without any need for additional extensions or other software. Unlike competing chain abstraction solutions, Signet ensures Zero Added Latency‚Ñ¢Ô∏è and zero additional gas fees.

### **Extra Life**

[üíï Extra Life](the-obi-smart-account-suite/extra-life.md) brings users and entreprises peace of mind, allowing users to set parameters for asset transfer due to unforeseen events. If their account is inactive for the set period of time, recovery will be available. This also allows the user to eventually recover their own funds in the event that their Multikey is lost in a black swan catastrophe.

## Obi Policies Offer New Tools to Enterprises&#x20;

### **Automatons**

[ü§ñ Automatons](the-obi-smart-account-suite/automatons.md) are permissioned agents that are allowed to take only certain actions or act within certain limits. Automatons are designed primarily as guardrails for automated systems such as AI bots and automatic subscription pulls.

***

### **Party Members and Allowances**

[üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Party Members](the-obi-smart-account-suite/party-members/) can participate in accounts with permissions policies and spending limits which keep their behavior within acceptable bounds. Similar to Automaton permissions, Party Members allows for budget, subscription, and treasury management with full policy auditability.
