# Obi: Cross-Chain User Management

**Obi is an all-chain, integrated smart account solution.**

Obi connects Web2 and Web3 experiences: all the security, features, and recoverability Web2 expects, with the sovereignty and interoperability of Web3.

Enterprises can ensure their users are custodying their own funds and interacting with applications safely and recoverably, all while enjoying access to powerful analytics and infrastructure.

All Obi accounts are multi-factor and cross-chain, and are compatible with all chains on any major architecture, including Bitcoin, EVM, Tendermint, Move, and Solana, without the need for setups, deployments, or installations.

Enterprises and users can also manage policies such as:

* fees
* sessions
* spend limits
* recovery or inheritance beneficiaries and partners
* subscriptions
* allow and block lists.
