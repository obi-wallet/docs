# ü•á Obi's Unique Advantages

## Multi-Chain Smart Accounts

Obi accounts are easy, seedless, and recoverable, with the ability to subsidize gas fees. But Obi architecture also offers many things unavailable in other solutions:

### Multichain: With Obi, one unified account, with unified recovery and rules, works on all blockchain networks.

Unlike other smart account solutions, Obi accounts are not just chain-agnostic or chain-compatible; they are multichain accounts ‚Äì where one account can act on all chains, without needing any cross-chain messaging or intermediary infrastructure. This means that one set of simple factors ‚Äì such as two devices, a phone number, an email, and a passport ‚Äì becomes a recoverable, updatable key for all your accounts, on all chains.

Obi accounts are automatically available on EVM chains (with the same user address), Bitcoin, and Cosmos SDK chains. Solana and Aptos/Sui are coming soon. Users can create additional, unique accounts if they wish, but all accounts have the same multi-factor security.

### Cost Savings: Obi saves you money by doing the heavy lifting before spending any transaction fees.

By performing transaction checking and signing as a free (no gas) view function/query, Obi accounts can quickly verify items such as rule matching and cryptographic signing without spending gas. The actual final transaction is submitted with this complex work already complete, so gas cost is minimal. A smart account transaction that needs to ask ‚ÄúIs the owner a session key, spending under their limit, on an allowed contract?‚Äù is an expensive transaction, so this work is quickly and seamlessly done ahead of time as a free action, without troubling the user.

### Flexible Privacy: Obi lets you choose who sees your account rules, keeping your business private.

Obi accounts can have private rules, with updatable and revocable viewing keys that allow parties (individuals, banks, lawyers) to view them if the user allows. Not everyone will want their inheritance accounts and terms to be plainly visible on chain. Obi encrypted state already allows smart account parameters to be private.

### MEV/Frontun Shielding: Obi Fast Travel transactions, while multi-step, do not broadcast the final step early.

Thanks to encrypted communication when the client queries for transaction signatures, the last step of a multi-step transaction is not known publicly when the transaction begins. This prevents frontrunning which could otherwise easily occur.

### Multichain Monetization: Obi transactions pay standard microfees across all blockchains.

Obi smart accounts can impose the current fees on transactions, refusing to sign actions which try to avoid the Obi fee. This applies to all chains: if an Obi account user executes a Bitcoin transaction which sends funds, they must attach the relevant Obi fee. Obi clients such as the Obi modal automatically do this. These native chain fees accumulate, providing rewards back to Obi nodes and stakers without relying on token inflation and incentivizing further adoption of Obi.

### Your ID is Your Account: With Obi, your existing personal life is your private, unique, key for all apps and chains.

Obi accounts are privately built on a person's ID, not just a Google login. Pieces of your life and identity ‚Äì phone, email, your devices, ID cards, social logins, friends, etc. ‚Äì can be used to authenticate you privately, whatever app and chain you're on. With enough keys, this approaches bank-grade authentication standards, with or without a custodial element.

### Inheritance and Recovery: Obi ensures your assets are safe and can be recovered or inherited.

Obi accounts can have failsafes at every step of an account‚Äôs lifecycle. Even if a user has multiple parts of their identity authentication destroyed, conditional recovery paths can kick in after a delay. This ultimate recovery can also ensure that accounts are passed on in the event that the user passes away. Human-written escrow-like contracts and special rules (such as proportional, incremental, or conditional distribution of inheritance) provide maximum flexibility ‚Äì making Obi the first scalable, non-custodial, multi-chain solution for insurance companies and trust attorneys. Disclosed inheritance service fees can be contributed back to Obi from inheritance amounts when inheritance is activated.

### Standardization and Insurability: Obi meets industry standards and is creating new standards, making it trustworthy and insurable for big organizations.

The application of modern web standards such as WebAuthN and ePassports, and the creation of new aggregate standards from these, will make Obi accounts a fully standardized account solution. Meeting strict industry standards will allow accounts to be adopted by organizations and insured.

### Resilience: Even if something happens to Obi or any part of its technical stack, your accounts are safe and can continue to be used.

Many solutions rely on a specific entity in a specific jurisdiction. They are one action away from being crippled or disabled, whether by a regulator, by a Web2 service provider, or by a bad actor from within or without. Obi accounts are currently recoverable even if something happens to Obi, and Obi has a roadmap to make everything ‚Äì from multi-chain accounts, to Multikey services, to monetization ‚Äì decentralized and resilient.

### Security: Obi architecture excludes many attacks and actively defends against others, keeping your assets secure even if an unknown exploit is discovered.

To prevent host web apps or games from mounting a man-in-the-middle attack, Obi uses iFrames for critical JavaScript. To defend against supply chain/dependency attacks, Obi is implementing jails (sandboxes) and automatic code validation. Core Obi account smart contracts are developed in Rust, a language widely known for safety, stability, and security, excluding several kinds of Solidity attacks. Firewall and notification layers prevent attacks even in the event of unknown exploits.
