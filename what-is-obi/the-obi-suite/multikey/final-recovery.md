# 💕 Final Recovery

[Allowances: Inheritance](../party-members/allowances-inheritance.md) are intended for passing on funds, and optionally ultimate full account control, to beneficiaries.

Additionally, though, an inheritance setup – on its own or in conjunction with normal inheritance – can also provide a “final recovery” path for any user who is concerned about permanently having their Multikey ruined through negligence, coordinated attack, or seizure of multiple personal items.

Following progressive onboarding, users can be prompted to set up Final Recovery and Inheritance if their account value becomes significant.
