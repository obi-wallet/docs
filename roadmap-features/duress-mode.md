# 🔧 Duress Mode

The most effective attack, the “wrench attack”, involves physically or otherwise _**coercing**_ the user to sign a transaction, such as transferring funds, or full account ownership. No amount of secure system design can prevent this attack. Except, that is, a duress mode.

By inputting an alternate pin code, using an alternate voice authentication phrase, or using an alternate security answer, the user can activate duress mode.

This unlocks a different account with minimal value. It can optionally also alert the user’s set emergency contacts or other parties.

This is comprehensive, automatic, customizable wrench attack protection.

(Note that if the user’s account address is already known by the attacker, this may be unconvincing. Even this eventuality may be mitigated in the future.)
