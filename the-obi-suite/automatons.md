### Worker Address

[Abstraction Rules](../glossary.md#abstraction-rule) often apply to other individuals, but they can also be used to implicitly create [intent](../glossary.md#intent)-bound addresses. Assets and other properties belonging to these addresses can only pursue the allowed intent. This allows non-custodial pre-authorized activity, such as [fast travel tunnels](automatons.md#fast-travel-tunnel), stop losses, and [triggered](automatons.md#trigger-list) actions, without needing special smart contract pools or custodial solutions.
