# üîç Signet

Obi Signet enables **multi-chain account abstraction** for the first time: with one secure account and one flexible set of rules, users can manage addresses, apps, and assets on any chains they wish.

With Signet, Obi Accounts on any chain can control addresses on any other chain, even without IBC connection. This can even allow an Obi extension or app to pretend to be any other wallet extension.

A transaction for a destination chain can be submitted by an actor to an Obi account, regardless of the smart account‚Äôs home chain. Account abstraction rules (see [Flex Accounts](https://www.notion.so/Flex-Accounts-5fb118a1929d452f80246c066c3eef7b?pvs=21)) are checked by the smart account. If an active rule is matched, including but not limited to these examples:

* the actor is the account owner, using multi-factor authentication
* the actor is an active session key
* the actor has an active budget

then the transaction is signed and broadcasted to the destination chain (e.g. Ethereum or Neutron). In many cases, this can be resolved via query so that there is no added block time delay or fee on the account home chain.

From Ethereum‚Äôs (or Neutron's) perspective in this example, an EOA private key signed a simple transaction. However, account abstraction rules were applied on a different layer, saving gas and enabling functionality which is not yet natively available on Ethereum.

From the user‚Äôs perspective, they simply submit an Ethereum (or Neutron) transaction in a dapp, using a normal address and normal Ethereum/Neutron assets. The smart account layer‚Äôs participation as account abstraction rule enforcer does not need to be visible to the user.

#### Version 1

A private key is created with shares $k\_1$ ‚Ä¶ $k\_4$, in a 2-of-4 setup. Factors of the Multikey are used to encrypt shares $k\_1$, $k\_2$, and $k\_3$, which are stored encrypted both on user device and on remote server.

Meanwhile, $k\_4$ is stored with a **share signer (Signet) contract** on a network that supports private data and computation. Currently, Secret Network is used for this purpose. In the future, a bespoke chain can be used, with Secret and other networks as backups.

This key is not directly retrievable, but it can be used to sign or to help rotate shares.

The Signet smart contract knows to ask its associated User Account if the transaction is authorized before signing with signature $sig\_{k4}$. This requires any of the following:

1. User Account has a contract presence on the share signer's network.
2. The Signet can query the account via ICQ (interchain query), with ownership proven by a signed message to exclude malicious relayer behavior.

This covers the following cases:

* Common usage: The user processes a transaction via their User Account. The account returns $sig\_{k4}$ (fees are appended to the final transaction, either by the application or by the contracts themselves). The user then can calculate $sig\_{k1}$ (or $sig\_{k2}$ or $sig\_{k3}$) and submitted the final signed transaction to the end chain: Bitcoin, Lightning, Ethereum, Optimism, Neutron, Atom, etc.
* Common recovery: The user loses some keys. Using the available shares, they rotate to new $k\_1...k\_4$. The Secret Network $k\_4$ must now be replaced, and the other keys are re-encrypted and re-stored locally and remotely. This can also apply if keys are stolen or if SGX is compromised.

#### **Version 2**

The second version of Obi Passport adds an **additional network**. This provides additional resilience against network downtime or failure or trusted execution environment exploits, even in the inheritance case. This second network holds a new $k\_{5}$ and is able to provide $sig\_{k5}$. Unlike Version 1, there are 2 network shares available.
