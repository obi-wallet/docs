# 💕 Extra Life

Extra Life passes on funds, and optionally ultimate full account control, to beneficiaries.

Additionally, though, an inheritance setup – on its own or in conjunction with normal inheritance – can also provide a “final recovery” path for any user who is concerned about permanently having their Multikey ruined through negligence, coordinated attack, or seizure of multiple personal items.

Following progressive onboarding, users can be prompted to set up Final Recovery and Inheritance if their account value becomes significant.

Inheritance works like a spend limit, but with some additional notes:

* Inheritance only activates after a dormancy period – a customizable minimum amount of time during which the main account must be inactive, indicating that something has happened to its owner.
* Inheritance spend limits are likely set as a percentage of assets – such as 5% per month – instead of numerical or dollar totals. If the `spendlimit` field is `[]`, 100% is available immediately.
* A “full control” time sets when beneficiaries receive full control of the Obi Account, unlocking any account assets which could not meaningfully be provided in a drip, as well as cross-chain signing potential.
* Setting an Inheritance Address in the User Interface
  * Go to the Accounts tab.
  * Create a new Inheritance Account.
  * Enter the address which will inherit funds. It can be an Obi Account or any other kind of address.
  * Set the parameters for the inheritance:
    * **Dormancy Period**: Your account must have no activity for this time period in order for inheritance to be claimable.
    * **Drip**: Your selected percentage of assets will be available each selected time period (for example, 5% per month). Rollover is not yet implemented.
    * **Full Control**: The recipient will receive full control of your account and be able to take any action on it after this amount of time has passed.
    * Note that any owner activity on the account will restart the Dormancy Period – even if inheritance is currently active.
  * Confirm your settings.
