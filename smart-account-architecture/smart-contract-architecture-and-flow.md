# üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture & Flow

You can view [interactive account flowcharts here](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/5b1a975e-f1a4-4893-94eb-70bbba792fde/edit?invitationId=inv\_d72b305e-e151-4ec2-adff-e699fa89a658\&page=0\_0) for the following actions:

* Create an Account
* Add an Abstraction Rule
* Execute a Cosmos Message
* Sign an EthUserOp
* Update User Account Contracts

An Obi account is set up by an Account Factory call, either by a user or by an entity pre-configuring an account which will be transferred to a user.

This creates a [_`user_entry`_](../glossary.md) contract, which is minimal. This contract knows the address of its `user_account` contract, the main logic hub. In this way, the `user_entry` can execute an account upgrade by pointing to a new `user_account` contract with updated code ‚Äì a sort of manual migration for chains where native migration/upgrade is not available.

The user account knows its [_owner_](../glossary.md) and the address of its `user_state` contract, where all _abstraction rules_ are stored. It also knows the addresses of various common logic contracts ‚Äì in particular, the gatekeepers which check the various kinds of abstraction rules against incoming transactions.

Gatekeeper logic contracts include:

* `gatekeeper_debt` (for managing account fee debt)
* `gatekeeper_message` (allow/block/delay listing for specified actors and/or contracts and/or message contents)
* `gatekeeper_spendlimit` (allowances, budgets, inheritance)

In some implementations, `gatekeeper_spendlimit` interacts with an Asset Unifier contract, which in turn uses a Token/LP Asset Registry. This way, debt and spend limits can be denominated in a single asset, currently USD. For now, this is under centralized control using vetted lists of contract addresses, but control can eventually be transferred to governance, and users can add or block specific entries.

When signing for a [_target chain_](../glossary.md) (not the home chain), the _actor_ does not directly interact with `user_entry`. Instead, the actor calls `Sign` on the [_threshold signer contract_](../glossary.md) and includes:

* partially completed offline signature shares (the signer will finalize with its share)
* if querying, proof that it controls an authorized keypair
* the [_user operation_](../glossary.md) (EVM) or transaction for which the actor is requesting a signature

The threshold signer contract verifies the _actor's_ identity and checks with the provided `user_entry` contract to verify that the user operation or transaction is allowed by some _abstraction rule,_ authorizing the actor to perform the operation. It also checks that any necessary fee is included, if the transaction is a send. Assuming these checks pass, it completes the signature and returns it.
