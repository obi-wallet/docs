# ⛓️ Multichain

Obi Accounts by necessity have a “home chain,” where the rules which govern transactions are stored and enforced. (This can be the same as the "signer chain," where threshold signatures are completed if the associated account allows the actor and message.)

However, although a “home chain” is necessary, Obi Accounts can still interact on **any blockchain** (including Bitcoin, Cosmos SDK, and EVM chains) thanks to Obi Passport and Wallet Mocking.
