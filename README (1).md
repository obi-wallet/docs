# 🔵 What is Obi?

_The contents of the Obi Public Docs are in progress and subject to change._

Obi is a blockchain-agnostic, modular, non-custodial solution for user account management, permissions, recovery, inheritance, intents, and security.

### Obi's flexible features allow non-custodial Web3 user experiences which are even easier and more recoverable than Web2 experiences.

Depending on your experience with various technologies, you may find it helpful to think of Obi as:

🧩 a **modular accounts blockchain** which quietly integrates with all chains, without requiring backend integration work or cross-chain messaging

🛠️ a robust **all-chain permission system,** allowing existing use cases such as [spend limits](glossary.md#spendlimit), [inheritance](glossary.md#inheritance), subscriptions, budgets, [session keys](glossary.md#sessionkey), [gasless](glossary.md#gasless-mpc) [MEV-shielded](glossary.md#mev-shielded-intent) cross-chain [intents](glossary.md#intent), and purpose-bound "worker addresses" – in addition to new use cases not yet deployed

🔑 a near-zero-latency gasless **MPC helper network** – like a Ledger hardware wallet adding to your security, but as a network – where even nodes, downtime, or secure hardware vulnerabilities do not jeopardize user funds or access

🔒 a **security network** bringing standardization to user accounts across blockchains

😄 an all-chain, seamless, recoverable, hack-resistant **user account experience**

Components of **the Obi stack** use multi-party computation (MPC), zero knowledge (ZK), and account abstraction (AA) technologies to create **non-custodial account and permission control** for users that is simple to use yet deeply resistant to attack and loss.

Obi smart accounts control any number of identities (accounts and rules for account behavior) across any number of [target chains](glossary.md#target-chain). Currently EVM and Cosmos SDK chains are supported, with limited Bitcoin support and with Solana and Aptos/Sui support coming soon.

**Multikey** makes onboarding and using Obi Accounts seedless, easy, recoverable, and hack and loss resistant.

**Flex Accounts** deploy the full power of account abstraction to enable subscriptions, inheritance, safe spend limits, session keys, allow/block lists, and more.

**Fast Travel** enables "Anything in Two Clicks" – quick converstion from ETH or other common assets into tokens or strategies in other ecosystems.
