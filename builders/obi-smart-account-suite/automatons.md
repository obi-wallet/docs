# ðŸ¤– Automatons

[Abstraction Rules](../../glossary.md#abstraction-rule) often apply to other individuals, such as with [extra-life.md](extra-life.md "mention") and [party-members](party-members/ "mention") â€“ but they can also be used to implicitly create [intent](../../glossary.md#intent)-bound addresses.&#x20;

Assets and other properties belonging to these Automaton addresses can only pursue the allowed intent. This allows non-custodial pre-authorized activity, such as [fast travel tunnels](automatons.md#fast-travel-tunnel), stop losses, and [triggered](automatons.md#trigger-list) actions, without needing special smart contract pools or custodial solutions.

Currently, Automatons are only used in the [obi.money](https://obi.money) interface for [Broken link](broken-reference "mention"), where they bridge assets for users. Other use cases can be achieved via CLI for special use cases.
