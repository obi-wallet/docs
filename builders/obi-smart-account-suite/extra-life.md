# üíï Extra Life

Extra Life passes on funds, and optionally ultimate full account control, to beneficiaries.

But you don't have to die to benefit from Extra Life! This "final recovery" solution can also come to your rescue if you suffer from:

‚Ä¢ coordinated attack on your Multikey

‚Ä¢ seizure or loss of multiple personal items and accounts at once

‚Ä¢ accidental, negligent, or intentional destruction of your Multikey

‚Ä¢ amnesia or other incapacitation

Extra Life is undergoing final internal testing and is coming soon to [obi.money.](https://obi.money) You will be prompted to set up Extra Life if your account value becomes significant, but you can also set it up manually at any time.

Extra Life is maximally flexible, allowing you to set several parameters for your inheritance/recovery:

* **dormancy period** ‚Äì a customizable minimum amount of time during which the main account must be inactive, indicating that something has happened to its owner
* **drip percentage** ‚Äì such as 5% per month
* **‚Äúfull control‚Äù event**, when beneficiaries receive full control of the Obi Account, unlocking any account assets which could not meaningfully be provided in a drip ‚Äì such as identities and optionally message-signing ability

Drip percentages can be created in parallel in order to create multi-user inheritance setups.
