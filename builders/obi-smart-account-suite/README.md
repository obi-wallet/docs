# ðŸ”µ The Obi Smart Account Suite

_The contents of the Obi Public Docs are in progress and subject to change._

## Web3 has never been this \*easy\* and \*safe\*.

Obi's flexible features allow non-custodial Web3 user experiences which are even easier and more recoverable than Web2 experiences.

### And Obi brings this to all chains and apps without any integration work required.

### Target chains do not even need to know about Obi's existence. It just works, wherever you are.

_Want the relevant buzzwords? Obi is a blockchain-agnostic, modular, non-custodial solution for user account management, permissions, recovery, inheritance, intents, and security._

_What about acronyms? Well, Obi uses Account Abstraction (AA) and multi-party computation (MPC) with threshold signature schemes (TSS) in a decentralized Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We haven't included Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) included yet, but we will soon._

### Check Out the Obi Product Suite:

**Multikey** replaces seed phrases and other single-key solutions with a zero-hassle, hack-resistant multi-factor solution. You own all of your keys, but none of the hassle. Secure, one-click onboarding and login.

Obi **Signet** technology allows your Multikey to control any assets and accounts on any blockchain â€“ EVM (Ethereum), Cosmos, Solana, Bitcoin, Move (Aptos/Sui) blockchains and more. All united in one recoverable, ultra-secure, ultra-easy account.

**Extra Life** allows safe non-custodial account recovery in extreme situations, such as when you lose many of your Multikey factors, or if you become incapacitated.

**Automatons** are worker addresses that can work independently across any chains but can only do exactly what you've allowed them to do. They're bound to your intent.

**Safe Sign-In** brings you a one-click login experience that is still safe. If anyone â€“ yourself included â€“ tries to spend too much or do something dangerous, your Multikey is required again.

**Party Members** are people you authorize to spend some funds. Budgets, allowances for your kids or your hot wallets, and subscription services are all great examples.
