# Dev Quickstart: Building Multi-Chain Apps

The [Tunnels repository](https://github.com/rustopian/tunnels-fun) is a fully implemented client and server application built with Obi capabilities: unified cross-chain accounts, gas abstraction for frictionless user experience, bridge aggregation, and more.

Thanks to cross-chain user management, users can start on any chain and end on any other chain, without needing to onboard or pay fees along the way.

Although this example application uses a simple aggregator, Obi guardrails can also be used with other policy engines, even AI, resulting in authorized agents who can act on users' behalf across all chains and apps, but only within the policies the users establish.
